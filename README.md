## Description

The `mco_rpc` module contains a task to run installed rpc agents through Puppet
Tasks with either bolt or the Puppet Orchestrator.

## Setup

The Puppet agent package and any rpc agents that are going to be run must be
installed on all target nodes. The MCO server does not have to be running and
there is no need for MCO middleware or messaging services.

## Usage

To run the package task with `bolt`

```
bolt task run mco_rpc --modulepath $MODULEPATH --nodes $TARGETNODES agent=pacakge action=install args='package=nano'
```

To run the package task with `puppet task`

```
puppet-task run mco_rpc $TARGETS agent=pacakge action=install arguments='package=nano'
```

## Reference

### Parameters

`agent String[1]`:
  The MCO RPC agent to run.

`action String[1]`:
  The action of the agent to run.

`data Optional[Hash]`:
  The options to pass to to the action. These vary per action.

`arguments Optional[String]`:
  A single string or arguments to the action as might be passed to the mco CLI
  ie. 'package=nano verson=2.8.7' This parameter and data are mutually
  exclusive.

## Limitations

This is a pre `1.0.0` release and future versions may have breaking changes.
This relies on the Puppet agent packaged ruby and the MCO gem to run.
